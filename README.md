Goal: To determine which music variables influence the virality of videos on TikTok

In the digital era and the evolution of social media platforms like TikTok, understanding the factors influencing content virality has become increasingly crucial. 
Therefore, this research aims to delve into the musical variables contributing to the popularity of content on TikTok, including aspects such as artist, beat of music, and the number of shares. Focusing on content that successfully garnered over 5,000 likes, this study employed a data analysis approach involving the librosa library for music tempo extraction and logistic regression to identify relationships among these variables. The research findings indicate that the most significant variable influencing the virality of music content on TikTok is the number of shares. This highlights that the phenomenon of virality is not solely dependent on musical characteristics like artist or beat but is more influenced by social interactions through video sharing among users. The findings suggest that when someone shares a video with others who may have similar music preferences, the video is likely to receive likes, even if it does not appear on the user's For You Page (FYP). Thus, the virality of content on TikTok can be explained by the existence of social connections among friends that trigger the viral spread of the video. These results provide valuable insights into the mechanisms behind the success of content on this platform.
